API-style documentation for your HealthAnalyzer++ C++ project. This is suitable for README files, developer references, or integration notes.

📊 HealthAnalyzer++: Blood Test Analysis Tool
Description:
HealthAnalyzer++ is a lightweight C++ application designed to analyze blood test reports from CSV files, compare the results to standard medical reference ranges, and provide basic health, nutrition, and exercise advice.

🔧 Compilation
bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -std=c++17 -o health_analyzer main.cpp
Ensure you have a valid CSV file at data/report.csv.

📁 CSV Input Format
File: data/report.csv

Expected Format:

cs
Copy
Edit
Name,Value,Unit
Hemoglobin,12.5,g/dL
WBC,7800,per µL
Cholesterol,210,mg/dL
Vitamin D,20,ng/mL
Name: The blood marker name (e.g., "Hemoglobin").

Value: Numeric value of the test result.

Unit: Unit of measurement (e.g., mg/dL, g/dL).

🔍 Functional Overview
struct Marker
Represents a single blood test entry.

cpp
Copy
Edit
struct Marker {
    std::string name;
    double value;
    std::string unit;
};
std::vector<Marker> parseCSV(const std::string& filepath)
Parses the CSV file into a vector of Marker objects.

Input: Filepath to CSV

Output: Vector of Marker structs

Throws: May throw std::invalid_argument or std::ifstream::failbit exceptions if file is invalid or corrupt.

🧠 Analysis Logic
Reference Ranges
cpp
Copy
Edit
std::map<std::string, std::pair<double, double>> refRanges = {
    {"Hemoglobin", {13.0, 17.0}},
    {"WBC", {4000, 10000}},
    {"Cholesterol", {0, 200}},
    {"Vitamin D", {30, 100}}
};
Each marker is compared against its reference range:

If below: marked "Low"

If above: marked "High"

Within range: marked "Normal"

🍽 Nutrition Advice
Given based on abnormalities:

Low Vitamin D → Sunlight + fatty fish

High Cholesterol → Avoid fats + increase fiber

Low Hemoglobin → Iron-rich diet

🏃 Exercise Suggestions
Always recommended:

30 min light cardio (5x/week)

Strength training (2x/week)

Daily stretching

--- Blood Test Report Analysis ---
Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL
  - Low. Consider consulting a doctor.
WBC: 7800 per µL
  - Normal.
Cholesterol: 210 mg/dL
  - High. May need lifestyle or medical changes.
Vitamin D: 20 ng/mL
  - Low. Consider consulting a doctor.

Nutrition Advice:
- Increase sun exposure and eat fatty fish (like salmon).
- Avoid saturated fats. Add oats and fiber-rich foods.
- Eat iron-rich foods (spinach, red meat, lentils).

Exercise Recommendation:
- 30 minutes of walking or light cardio, 5 days a week.
- Include strength training twice a week.
- Stretch daily.
✅ Future Improvements
Add unit testing for CSV parsing and range checks.

Support configurable reference ranges via JSON or config files.

Extend nutrition/exercise advice based on multiple combined markers.

Add GUI support or web API integration.
